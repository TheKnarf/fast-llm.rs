# Fast-LLM powered by Candle ðŸ¦€

Yo! I really have no clue what I'm doing here, but here's me trying to make the quantised llm examples into its own package.

None of the work here is original and all attributions should go to Laurent & Nicolas who made this gem of an example.


## How do you run this bad boi?

Step 1: `git clone https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/fast-llm.rs/`

Step 2: `cd fast-llm.rs`

Step 3: `cargo run --release`
